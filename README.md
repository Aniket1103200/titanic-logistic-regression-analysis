### Titanic Passenger Survival Analysis with Logistic Regression  

---

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using logistic regression. By analyzing demographic and ticket-related data, the model determines whether a passenger is likely to survive or not. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, has been semi-cleaned to enable efficient analysis and modeling.  

---------------

## **Dataset Features**  
The Titanic dataset includes various attributes that contribute to the survival prediction:  
- **Passenger Class**: Indicates socio-economic status (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).  
- **Gender**: Male or female passenger.  
- **Age**: Passenger's age.  
- **Fare**: Ticket fare paid by the passenger.  
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses traveling together.  
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children traveling with the passenger.

## **Objective**  
The primary objective is to use logistic regression for binary classification, predicting the probability of survival based on the dataset's features. The project also aims to evaluate the model's effectiveness through various metrics.

## **Key Highlights**  
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and analyzed the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Selected relevant features for optimal performance.  

2. **Model Development**:  
   - Trained a logistic regression model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
